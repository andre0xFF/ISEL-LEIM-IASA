<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This final report aims to describe and explain all the subjects studied in the Artificial Intelligence for Autonomous Systems class. During the semester three projects were developed with the provided architectural system models.</p>
<p>The first project simulates the interactions between an agent and an environment which the agent belongs to. When the simulation starts the gatekeeper goes into patrol mode. In case of hearing a noise the gatekeeper inspects the area, searching for the noise’s origin. If there is no longer any noise, then he continues to patrol. At any time the gatekeeper may encounter an enemy and in that case he must protect the area and warn the foe to retreat. In this situation, if the enemy backs off, he will remain inspecting the area for any source of noise. In case the enemy persists, the gatekeeper will have to defend himself and fight the threat. In combat situation two actions may occur. The gatekeeper can be victorious and defeat the enemy and, then, he goes back to patrol; or in case of defeat the simulation is restarted. The interaction, at any level, is made by text inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>The second project implement an autonomous resolution system of the 8 puzzle problem. The initial problem presents two puzzle configurations to be solved, but the main objective is to develop a solution that is able to solve any kind of puzzle configuration or, even further, any kind of problem that fits the developed problem model. The 8 puzzle problem is a smaller version of the slightly better known 15 puzzle game. The puzzle consists of an area divided into a grid of 3 by 3. On each grid square is a tile, except for one square which remains empty. Thus, there are eight tiles. A tile that is next to the empty grid square can be moved into the empty space, leaving the previous position empty in turn. Tiles are numbered, 1 to 8, so that each tile can be uniquely identified. The puzzle is solved using multiple search algorithms such as bread-first search, depth-first search and other variants.</p>

<h1 id="artificial-intelligence-overview">Artificial intelligence overview</h1>
<p><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> has always intrigued people, from TV shows, movies and marketing using robots with pseudo-intelligence. It is the perfect topic to craft thrillers, adventures and dramas, just like the well known Terminator movie or the brilliant Westworld TV show.</p>
<p>The most basic definition of intelligence is: <em>the ability to learn and solve problems.</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> This is regardless of being human intelligence or machine intelligence. So artificial intelligence could be described as the <em>intelligence exhibited by machines or software.</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> To be more specific it’s the study and design of intelligent agents - a system that perceives it’s environment and takes actions that maximizes its chances of success.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="definition-throughout-history">Definition throughout history</h2>
<p>As history goes on the definition of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> has changed and four approaches mastered their own definition.</p>
<h3 id="thinking-humanly">Thinking humanly</h3>
<p>The cognitive approach in which machines are designed with minds, machines that think in the full and literal sense. It requires scientific theories of internal activities of the brain and how humans think.</p>
<h3 id="acting-humanly">Acting humanly</h3>
<p>Machines have to act and do things like humans. This was the definition purposed by Alan Turing in the well known Turing Test: where a computer passes the test if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written responses come from a person or a computer. The major components suggested by Alan Turing were: knowledge, reasoning, language understanding and learning.</p>
<h3 id="thinking-rationally">Thinking rationally</h3>
<p><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> is made using math merged with logic. It uses some notations and rules of inference or derivations for thoughts to codify all knowledge in this representation and use it to derive new knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="acting-rationally">Acting rationally</h3>
<p>Intelligent systems are designed to act and to maximize their goal. The intelligent agents are expected to maximize the goal achievement giving the available information about the environment, the background knowledge, past experiences and other useful information.</p>
<p>This last approach is the one adopted in the study objectives of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence for Autonomous Systems">IASA</abbr> class.</p>
<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
<p><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> is present in people’s daily lives without their awareness. Some applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speech recognition:  Used by virtual assistants like Google Now, Siri and Amazon Echo;</li>
<li>Hand writing recognition: Used by banks to recognize checks information;</li>
<li>Machine translation: To translate sentences from one language to another;</li>
<li>Robotics: Robots can be used in many fields such as robotics surgery, navigation etc;</li>
<li>Spam filters: Used by email clients to filter out spam emails. These filters can learn over time based on user actions and classification techniques;</li>
<li>Face recognition: Used to identify faces and people’s emotions in photographs and videos;</li>
<li>Medical imaging: Used to analyze patient’s exams and detect diseases;</li>
<li>Autonomous vehicles: Vehicles that can drive autonomously without the intervention of a human.</li>

<li>Agent vs objects</li>
<li><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3:1">3</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>An agent perceives its own environment and act upon that environment to achieve a certain task. An agent could be seen as a function <code>f</code> that goes from something that he perceives <code>P</code> to a set of actions <code>A</code>.</p>

<p>Rational agents can be defined as agents that do the right thing and rationality is relative to how to act in order to maximize a performance measure - factor that describes how well the agent is doing when performing a certain task to reach a certain goal.</p>

<p>One of the great promises of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> is its potential to help us unearth new knowledge in complex domains. We’ve already seen exciting glimpses of this, when our algorithms found ways to dramatically improve energy use in data centres - as well as of course with our program AlphaGo.</p>

<p>Everyone uses <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>:<br>
The term artificial intelligence is thrown around a lot these days, but usually, when a startup says they’re applying <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> to some problem, it just means they are using machine learning in varying degrees of sophistication. And there is a big difference. Not to say machine learning doesn’t have huge potential for automation and optimizing computer responses to various problems, but artificial intelligence is at a completely different level.<br>
