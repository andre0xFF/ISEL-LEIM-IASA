<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This final report aims to describe and explain all the subjects studied in the Artificial Intelligence for Autonomous Systems class. During the semester three projects were developed with the provided architectural system models.</p>
<p>The first project simulates the interactions between an agent and an environment which the agent belongs to. When the simulation starts the gatekeeper goes into patrol mode. In case of hearing a noise the gatekeeper inspects the area, searching for the noise’s origin. If there is no longer any noise, then he continues to patrol. At any time the gatekeeper may encounter an enemy and in that case he must protect the area and warn the foe to retreat. In this situation, if the enemy backs off, he will remain inspecting the area for any source of noise. In case the enemy persists, the gatekeeper will have to defend himself and fight the threat. In combat situation two actions may occur. The gatekeeper can be victorious and defeat the enemy and, then, he goes back to patrol; or in case of defeat the simulation is restarted. The interaction, at any level, is made by text inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>The second project implement an autonomous resolution system of the 8 puzzle problem. The initial problem presents two puzzle configurations to be solved, but the main objective is to develop a solution that is able to solve any kind of puzzle configuration or, even further, any kind of problem that fits the developed problem model. The 8 puzzle problem is a smaller version of the slightly better known 15 puzzle game. The puzzle consists of an area divided into a grid of 3 by 3. On each grid square is a tile, except for one square which remains empty. Thus, there are eight tiles. A tile that is next to the empty grid square can be moved into the empty space, leaving the previous position empty in turn. Tiles are numbered, 1 to 8, so that each tile can be uniquely identified. The puzzle is solved using multiple search algorithms such as bread-first search, depth-first search and other variants.</p>

<h1 id="artificial-intelligence-overview">Artificial intelligence overview</h1>
<p><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> has always intrigued people, from TV shows, movies and marketing using robots with pseudo-intelligence. It is the perfect topic to craft thrillers, adventures and dramas, just like the well known Terminator movie or the brilliant Westworld TV show.</p>
<p>The most basic definition of intelligence is: <em>the ability to learn and solve problems.</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> This is regardless of being human intelligence or machine intelligence. So artificial intelligence could be described as the <em>intelligence exhibited by machines or software.</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> To be more specific it’s the study and design of intelligent agents - a system that perceives it’s environment and takes actions that maximizes its chances of success.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="definition-throughout-history">Definition throughout history</h2>
<p>As history goes on the definition of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> has changed and four approaches mastered their own definition.</p>
<h3 id="thinking-humanly">Thinking humanly</h3>
<p>The cognitive approach in which machines are designed with minds, machines that think in the full and literal sense. It requires scientific theories of internal activities of the brain and how humans think.</p>
<h3 id="acting-humanly">Acting humanly</h3>
<p>Machines have to act and do things like humans. This was the definition purposed by Alan Turing in the well known Turing Test: where a computer passes the test if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written responses come from a person or a computer. The major components suggested by Alan Turing were: knowledge, reasoning, language understanding and learning.</p>
<h3 id="thinking-rationally">Thinking rationally</h3>
<p><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> is made using math merged with logic. It uses some notations and rules of inference or derivations for thoughts to codify all knowledge in this representation and use it to derive new knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="acting-rationally">Acting rationally</h3>
<p>Intelligent systems are designed to act and to maximize their goal. The intelligent agents are expected to maximize the goal achievement giving the available information about the environment, the background knowledge, past experiences and other useful information.</p>
<p>This last approach is the one adopted in the study objectives of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence for Autonomous Systems">IASA</abbr> class.</p>
<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
<p><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> is present in people’s daily lives without their awareness. Some applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speech recognition:  Used by virtual assistants like Google Now, Siri and Amazon Echo;</li>
<li>Hand writing recognition: Used by banks to recognize checks information;</li>
<li>Machine translation: To translate sentences from one language to another;</li>
<li>Robotics: Robots can be used in many fields such as robotics surgery, navigation etc;</li>
<li>Spam filters: Used by email clients to filter out spam emails. These filters can learn over time based on user actions and classification techniques;</li>
<li>Face recognition: Used to identify faces and people’s emotions in photographs and videos;</li>
<li>Medical imaging: Used to analyze patient’s exams and detect diseases;</li>
<li>Autonomous vehicles: Vehicles that can drive autonomously without the intervention of a human.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="intelligent-agents">Intelligent agents</h1>
<p>An <strong>agent</strong> perceives its own environment and act upon that environment to achieve a certain task. It can be seen as a function <code>f</code> that goes from something that he perceives <code>P</code> to a set of actions <code>A</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?f%3AP%5Crightarrow%20A#center" alt="Agent function"></p>
<p>In general intelligent agents are composed by sensors that sense the environment and get percepts from it and actuators that act upon that environment. These generated actions are a byproduct of thinking and deliberating given on what its observed or sensed from the environment — the cycle or the loop of an agent.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/E3dXwhU.png#center" alt="Agent initial design"></p>
<p>A human agent has eyes and ears as sensors and hands, legs, mouth and other body parts as actuators while a robotic agent would have cameras and motion sensors and multiple motors as actuators. Examples of robotic agents: thermostats, smartphones, self-driving cars, vacuum cleaners.</p>
<h2 id="rationality">Rationality</h2>
<p>An agent should do its best given what it is observing and given whatever background knowledge the agent has, more specifically rationality is relative to a <abbr title="factor that describes how well the agent is doing when performing a certain task to reach a certain goal">performance measure</abbr>.</p>
<p>Rational agents can be defined as agents that do the right thing and rationality is relative to how to act in order to maximize a <abbr title="factor that describes how well the agent is doing when performing a certain task to reach a certain goal">performance measure</abbr> — factor that describes how well the agent is doing when performing a certain task to reach a certain goal. An agent must then figure out the actions or a set of actions that lead to the goal while considering the impact of its actions on future states.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For each possible percept sequence, a rational agent should select an action that is expected to maximize its <abbr title="factor that describes how well the agent is doing when performing a certain task to reach a certain goal">performance measure</abbr>, given the evidence provided by the percept sequence and whatever built-in knowledge the agent has.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3:1">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="agent-properties">Agent properties</h2>
<p>The properties of a rational agent can be grouped under the acronym PEAS (Performance, Environment, Actuators, Sensor). These definitions are actually the problem specifications, for the task environment that the rational agent is meant to solve.</p>
<p>Considering the PEAS for a self-driving car: The performance could be the safety of the passengers, obedience of driving rules (stopping at red lights or driving under speed limit for example); the environment is all the roads, other cars, pedestrians, road signs; the actuators are everything that makes the car move, steering, brakes; the sensors include a camera, a sonar, a GPS, a speedometer.</p>
<h2 id="environment-properties">Environment properties</h2>
<p>Agents can operate in a multitude of environments. These environments need to be categorized in order to assess the agent’s sensors and actuators.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Fully observable</strong> (vs <strong>partially observable</strong>): An agent’s sensors give it access to the complete state of the environment at each point in time;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deterministic</strong> (vs <strong>stochastic</strong>): The next state of the environment is completely determined by the current state and the action executed by the agent. On the opposite there is a non-deterministic environment, or stochastic, in which uncertainty about outcomes is modeled or quantified in terms of probabilities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Episodic</strong> (vs <strong>sequential</strong>): The agent’s experience is divided into atomic “episodes” (each episode consists of the agent perceiving and then performing a single action), and the choice of action in each episode depends only on the episode itself;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Static</strong> (vs <strong>dynamic</strong>): The environment is unchanged while an agent is deliberating. It can also be called semi-dynamic if the environment does not change with the passage of time but the agent’s performance score does;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discrete</strong> (vs <strong>continuos</strong>): A limited number of distinct, clearly and well defined percepts and actions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Single agent</strong> (vs <strong>multiagent</strong>): An agent operating by itself in an environment;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Known</strong> (vs <strong>unknown</strong>): The designer of the agent may have knowledge about the environment.</p>
</li>

<p>An <strong>action</strong> or set of actions can be called a <strong>path</strong>, that will lead to a certain goal and paths may come in different costs or depths. Paths are explored using <a href="#uninformed-search-strategies">uninformed search strategies</a> or <a href="#informed-search-strategies">informed search strategies</a>.</p>
<p>The 8 queen problem is a typical problem where search strategies are used to reach the goal of placing 8 queens, on a chess board, so that no queen is attacking any other horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The algorithm will search for possible configurations where no queen attacks another one.</p>
<p><img src="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/QueensMin_700.gif#center" alt="8 queen problem"></p>
<p>Another practical use is route finding between two cities. For example to go from Lisbon to Madrid there are several routes that can be chosen, but which one is the optimal route? This problem can be analysed considering a map represented by a <strong>graph</strong> in which the nodes represent cities and the edges represent the roads.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5E0mHkZ.png#center" alt="Graph of cities"></p>
<p>There are multiple ways on how to perform a search to find the optimal route; once the optimal solution is found then the agent can execute the path: The optimal route is Lisbon → Coimbra → Madrid.</p>

<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> is a complex topic because it involves major components like languages, reasoning, knowledge, learning and understanding<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>. It’s also a broad topic with high impact on humanity and society.</p>
<p><abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> systems, do not have to model human or nature but may be inspired by human or nature, similar to an airplane and a bird.</p>
<p>The public opinion is whether <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> is a threat to humankind. Indeed <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> may raise some uncertainty about the future and whether people’s jobs will be replaced by <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> systems or whether <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> would take over the world just like in the movies. This comes from all kinds of people, even people with bright minds like Stephen Hawkins. This kind of concern tell us one thing, that <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> is a very powerful tool that is still in the beginning.</p>
<p>One of the great promises of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> is its potential to help us unearth new knowledge in complex domains. We’ve already seen exciting glimpses of this, when our algorithms found ways to dramatically improve energy use in data centers - as well as of course with our program AlphaGo.</p>

<p>Everyone uses <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>:<br>
The term artificial intelligence is thrown around a lot these days, but usually, when a startup says they’re applying <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> to some problem, it just means they are using machine learning in varying degrees of sophistication. And there is a big difference. Not to say machine learning doesn’t have huge potential for automation and optimizing computer responses to various problems, but artificial intelligence is at a completely different level.<br>
